Built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, this site reflects not just what I can do, but why I do it. Every animation, every interaction, is intentional — designed to feel like you're not browsing a website, but decoding a mind.`,

After losing his real ones and feeling suffocated by shallow social circles in college, he took a step back from everything. In solitude, he discovered the peace he'd been searching for all along. This letter is his quiet answer to the world that kept asking, "What happened to you?"`,

    desc: `The Art of Becoming the Author' is a journey through the torn pages of memory, the poetry of pain, and the quiet strength it takes to pick up the pen again. It dives deep into the chaos of emotion and rises through the power of imagination — a raw, heartfelt exploration of creativity, heartbreak, healing, and self-authorship. This isn't just a story. It's an invitation — to find your own voice, to own your narrative, and to finally write the version of yourself the world hasn't read yet.`,
